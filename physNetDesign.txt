physNet general description
	-physNet is a 2D physics engine
	-intended to be the controller of an entity-based system
		-the base IObject interface defines a position, velocity, and rotation which entities will use
		-the ICollider interface defines broad and narrow-phase bounds for an object, managing collisions
	-objects are ran through their simulation, and colliders are corrected

	Frame (receives deltaTime value)
	|	Broadphase initial	
	|	|	Relocate all nonstatic objects
	|	Broad->Narrow
	|	|	loop thru all objects
	|	|	|	query range (O(log n))
	|	|	|	run GJK collision detection
	|	|	|	if they overlap -> run EPA manifold generation
	|	|	|	throw manifold into a list (manifold: normal vec2, overlap double, contactA vec2, contactB vec2, tangentA vec2, tangentB vec2)
	|	Resolution
	|	|	loop thru N iterations
	|	|	|	loop thru all manifolds
	|	|	|	|	run all collision constraints
	|	|	|	run all extraneous constraints
	|	Simulation
	|	|	move all IPhysObjects
