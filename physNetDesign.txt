physNet general description
	-physNet is a 2D physics engine
	-intended to be the controller of an entity-based system
		-the base IObject interface defines a position, velocity, and rotation which entities will use
		-the ICollider interface defines broad and narrow-phase bounds for an object, managing collisions
	-objects are ran through their simulation, and colliders are corrected
